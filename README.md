# EAI4Math

**Goal**: Our project will proceed in two phases:
1. Improve autoformalization of complex informal mathematical statements with a retrieval + library learning approach.
2. Apply tree-search guided expert iteration strategies on autoformalized statements and theorems to train a strong formal theorem prover.
